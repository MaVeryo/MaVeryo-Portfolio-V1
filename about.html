                47.607755, -122.339188. This photo was when I went to Seattle, which is one of the most beautiful cities I've gone too. I got the opportunity to do a mini job shadowing with my cousin who is 
                in the CS field. I got to learn about a lot of things from the Corporate perspective to the managing the solo adult life.

          <h5>Traveling</h5>
            <p>
              Traveling erases biases, opens my mind to diverse viewpoints and cultures, and heightens my sense of adventure. 
              Each vacation is a chance to engage in unique activities, savor culture-rich cuisine, and immerse in the vibrant spirit of other places. 
              It's not merely about fun; it fosters ongoing learning and personal growth. 
              Embracing diversity and adaptability are valuable life lessons I've gained from travel, constantly broadening my horizons and fueling my passion for discovery.
              Grateful for the world's abundance, I cherish the opportunities it offers.

                This is still one of my favorites taken as it brings out a lot of colors from the sky and the sea,
                yet it doesn't distract from the boats.

          <h5> Photography </h5>
          <p> 
            As a beginner in photography, my passion for it is driven by various reasons. 
            I delight in tinkering with camera settings to capture the perfect shot. 
            Post-processing and editing let me add a personal touch and create original visual stories, expressing myself creatively. 
            Photography holds a special place in my heart as it helps me revisit and relive precious moments. 
            It's an effective tool for stirring emotions and sharing my artistic vision, connecting with others through compelling pictures.

                42.086997, -71.273242. These may seem like just cars but talking to the individuals that own the 
                cars inspired me to do more. They talked about their hardships and failures which not many people do now a days.
                They have told me to keep going and overall insipried me to become a better individual.

          <h5>Cars</h5>
          <p>
            My interest in cars covers diverse aspects, including mechanical and software-based developments. 
            The complexity and engineering marvels of different car types captivate me. 
            Cars can become unique statement pieces through modifications allowing the owner to reflect their personality. 
            The ever-changing automotive world inspires and excites me, fueling my passion for this hobby.
